## **Misleading Graphs**

The "Second Visualization" files contain all the information of this project. It explains our process, has the code and the final visualizations, and links to both our transformed data, as well as the orginal source, (both of which can also be found in this folder)

In this graph we aimed to find a relationship between target audience and the specific contents of a dayâ€™s tweets. First looking at the raw data set, we were interested in finding and understanding the categories of tweets that made up the two target audiences. As with most functional visualizations, we worked to match our mark to this relationship, which led us to a few mark types relating part to whole. We initially settled on a stacked bar graph, as it also allowed us to read the total number of tweets in the two audiences, however despite our best efforts with using good color, labels, and descriptions, this graph never felt fully intuitive. Only after our conversation with Dakota and Claire did we realize that the best, and most understandable mark for visualizing the breakdown of a target audience was a pie chart. Before this discovery, we optimized the rest of the visualization to best, most naturally, communicate the relationships we were seeking. Beginning with color, we chose a pallet that contained distinct colors, as to easily associate a slice of the pie with a category, as well as added bold borders around all slices to ensure no two categories blended together, ensuring all data was readable and clear. Further, we chose bold colors for all the labels so that they stood apart from all the pie chart slices and background. And of course, we made sure the colors looked nice too! For the labels we first put all the percentages on the pie slices to ensure that both high level patterns and all raw, numeric values were readily available to the reader. We also made a strong effort to communicate what the parts are and what the whole is through the titles of both the visualization and the legend. In doing this we upheld a readable, and intuitive visualization, effective at communicating the relationships we sought to find.
